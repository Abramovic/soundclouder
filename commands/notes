This requires Aerospike. For docker users please run

docker run -tid --name aerospike -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 -p 3002:3002 -p 3003:3003 aerospike/aerospike-server

To run against all of SoundCloud...
./grab_tracks config.json

I have  made the assumption that you might run 10 processes...

./grab_tracks config.json 0 -- only looks at tracks that end with "0"
./grab_tracks config.json 1 -- only looks at tracks that end with "1"

By storing information in Aerospike we will ignore any tracks that don't exist to avoid over-hitting the SoundCloud API
